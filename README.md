# Uber-Trip-Analysis-and-Visualization-2025
🚖 Uber Trip Analysis & Visualization 2025
📌 Overview

This project analyzes 100,000+ Uber trip records to uncover insights into ride demand, peak hours, regional performance, and revenue trends.
The pipeline includes data cleaning, ETL processing, and dashboard visualization using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end business intelligence workflows: from raw data ingestion to actionable insights for pricing optimization, driver allocation, and demand forecasting.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Programming & Databases: Python, SQL, MySQL, Pandas, NumPy

Business Intelligence & Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Engineering: ETL pipeline design, Data Cleaning & Transformation

Cloud & Warehousing (Conceptual): Azure Data Factory (ADF), Snowflake, ADLS Integration (planned / future scope)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

🔄 Data Flow / ETL Process

Extract: CSV files containing Uber trip records (~100K rows).

Transform:

Clean missing values & duplicates

Standardize trip details (distance, duration, city codes)

Feature engineering (peak hour flag, weekday/weekend, revenue category)

Load:

Processed datasets stored in structured SQL tables

Designed for fact/dimension schema (ride facts, driver dimension, region dimension).

Visualize: Power BI dashboards → revenue, demand, driver performance, KPIs.

📊 Key Dashboards & Insights

Revenue Trends: City-wise and time-based revenue comparisons

Peak Demand Analysis: Hourly & weekday/weekend demand fluctuations

Driver Performance: Average trips, revenue per driver, peak allocations

Regional Trends: Top zones for demand & profitability

➡️ Result: Automated reporting pipelines reduced manual effort by 40%, and insights supported better pricing strategies & peak-hour driver allocation.
